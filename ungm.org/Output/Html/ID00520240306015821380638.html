The UNDP will respond in writing, including an explanation of the request without identifying the source of the request. Please indicate whether you have launched an offer by creating a response project without submitting it directly in the system. This will allow the Denvoyer system notifications in case the requirements of LOFFRE are modified. If you need more details, please contact us using the system messaging function. The offers must be submitted directly to the system by following this link: http://supplier.quantum.partnerangecies.org/ using the profile you have on the portal. If you have never registered before, you can save a profile using the shared distance link via recruitment wash and by following the instructions in the guides available on the UNDP website: https://www.undp.org/ Provide/business/Resources-For-Bidders. Do not create a new profile if you already have one. Use the forgotten password function in case you do not remember the password or the previous name of the previous record.</td>
